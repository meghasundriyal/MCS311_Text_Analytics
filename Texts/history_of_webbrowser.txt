HISTORY OF WEB BROWSER

A web browser is an application used to locate, view and access information on the world wide web. Today’s browsers are fully functional software suites that can interpret  
and dsiplay HTML Web pages, images, video and many other files. But the situation was in different when the web browsers were first developed. 

If we look into the history of web browsers, the first web browser called WorldWideWeb, was developed back in 1990 by Tim Berners Lee. WWW was developed for NeXT Computer and later renamed to Nexus to avoid confusion between World Wide Web and Web Browser. Nexus was a text based web browser and only way to access the web at that time. But the major issue was that the people with technical knowledge would use that only. 

Then came Lynx in 1992, again a text based browser. Then in the same year came Erwise, which was the first browser with GUI developed as a student project but discontinued in 1994. On 1993, Cello was released. It was one of the first graphical web browsers and first to run on Windows. 

The explosion in popularity of the Web was triggered by Mosaic which was a graphical browser running originally on Unix and soon ported to the Amiga and VMS platforms, and later the Apple Macintosh and Microsoft Windows platforms. It's largely credited as the first browser to truly popularise web browsing by displaying images embedded within the text. This browser bought a remarkable change in browsers’ world. Inspired by the success of Mosaic, in 1994, Netscape released its flagship Navigator.  

Released in 1995, Microsoft’s Internet Explorer made its debut. It was included as part of the Microsoft Windows operating system. It was first released as part of the add-on package Microsoft Plus! for Windows. But was released as a free download three months later. By the end of the year, the First Browser War begun. It was the period of intense competition between two famous web browsers - Netscape and Microsoft – for dominance in the usage share of web browsers. New versions of both IE and Netscape were released at a rapid  pace over the following years. The phase gave birth to many advanced features in browsing, including Netscape’s JavaScript and IE’s CSS implementation. During these releases, it was common for web designers to display 'best viewed in Netscape' or 'best viewed in Internet Explorer' logos. However, in response to this "Viewable With Any Browser" campaign was started. Finally, Microsoft ended up winning the browser wars, and IE came to dominate the market in the 1990s. Internet Explorer became the most popular web browser and attained a peak of about 95% usage share by 2003. While the Browser War going on, Opera was released, which was started as a research project in 1994 at Telenor. After two years, in 1996, Opera was first publicly released and ran only on Windows systems. Opera has originated features later adopted by other web browsers, including: Speed Dial, pop-up blocking, re-opening recently closed pages, private browsing, and tabbed browsing. It also included a bookmarks bar and a download manager. Later in 1998, in an attempt to capitalize on the emerging market for Internet-connected handheld devices, a project to port Opera to mobile device platforms was started. 

Unable to continue commercially funding their product's development, Netscape responded by open sourcing its product, creating Mozilla Project. In 2002, Mozilla launched Firefox. It was launched as a free, open-source browser, in the wake of the demise of Netscape Navigator at the hands of Internet Explorer. 

In 2003, Apple's first web browser Safari was released with Macintosh computers previously shipping with Netscape Navigator or Cyberdog. In the same year, Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer would no longer be made available as a separate product but would be part of the evolution of its Windows platform. 
In 2007, Mobile Safari was introduced as Apple’s mobile web browser and continues to dominate the iOS market. By the end of 2007, Opera Mini 4 was released to focus on the fast-growing mobile browser market. It includes the ability to view web pages similarly to a desktop based browser by introducing Overview and Zoom functions, and a landscape view setting. 

Chrome, a cross platform web browser developed by Google, was released in 2008 for Microsoft Windows, and was later ported to Linux, macOS, iOS, and Android. Now, it has taken over the browser market. Chrome allows users to synchronize their bookmarks, history, and settings across all devices with the browser installed by sending and receiving data through a chosen Google Account, which in turn updates all signed-in instances of Chrome. As a weapon in the war against Google's web dominance, Microsoft released Microsoft Edge in 2015. It was first released for Windows 10 and Xbox One in 2015, then for Android and iOS in 2017,and macOS in 2019. 
Edge includes integration with Cortana and has extensions hosted on the Microsoft Store. As of August 2019, according to StatCounter, Edge still has a lower market share than Internet Explorer. With the market share of both combined, the Microsoft browsers place second after Chrome on traditional PCs. 
From WorldWideWeb to Microsoft Edge, the world of web browsers has grown tremendously.
